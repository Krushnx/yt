    "So it means i shall go for ms in business analytics instead of ms data analytics?",
    "IMO one of the best videos to give an updated overview on data analytics future and what matters the most, which is to learn the business values",
    "Is foreseeable future 5 years or 10…?",
    "Hi! I'm finishing my 3-year degree in Statistics and now I find myself in a position where I have to decide in which way to proceed for my future. I'm trying to absorbe more knowledge possible to do the right choice, and to do so I'm asking also to experienced people like you some suggestions. For example, if it make sense to me, doing my degree, to take the certificates given by coursera in Data Analytics. Also, if it's better to me to start working or get specialized in a most specific field with a master.  I'll have 100 more questions but for now I stop here. Thanks in advance!",
